Ipsedixit
=========

**ip-sah-diks-it**; Something that is asserted but unproved.

Ipsedixit is a lightweight provider of arbitrary data, stubs and dummies for your Java testing pleasure. It is designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate setup code in your tests, allowing you to spend more time solving more interesting problems (or drinking coffee).
